Subject: Improve Resident Engagement with Large-Print Brain Training Puzzles

Dear [Activity Director Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out because we've developed a puzzle program specifically designed for senior care facilities that has shown remarkable results in improving resident engagement and cognitive stimulation.

Our large-print puzzle collections have helped facilities like yours:
• Increase daily activity participation by 40%
• Reduce resident anxiety and restlessness
• Provide meaningful cognitive stimulation
• Create opportunities for social interaction

What makes our program different:
✓ Extra-large print (no magnifying glass needed)
✓ Progressive difficulty levels for all abilities
✓ Themed puzzles that resonate with seniors
✓ Complete activity guides for staff
✓ Monthly fresh content delivery

We're currently offering a FREE 2-week trial for qualified facilities. This includes:
- 20 assorted large-print puzzles
- Activity implementation guide
- Staff training materials
- Engagement tracking tools

Would you be interested in trying this with your residents? I'd be happy to send you our free trial package.

Best regards,
[Your name]
P.S. We also offer white-label options if you'd like puzzles branded with your facility's logo.
