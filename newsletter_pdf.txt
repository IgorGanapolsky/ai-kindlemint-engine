Wisdom of the Agents

What we're reading this week
We believe fortune favors the italics â€“ people who think things through

with a crowd of AI agents. In this newsletter, we'll share the best of what
we've read on simulators, AI personas, and synthetic market research this
week.

I asked Homer Simpson "what do you think about DSPy for prompt
optimisation?"

"D'oh! DSPy? Is that some kind of fancy new donut? I'm all for optimizing
donuts. Hmm, maybe I could optimize how I eat them? One bite, two bites...
five bites? Nah, I'll stick to stuffing them all in my face at once. Mmm,
donuts.
