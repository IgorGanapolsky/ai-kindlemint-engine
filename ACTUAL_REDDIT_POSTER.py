The neurologist was stunned. Asked what her secret was.

"45 minutes of puzzles every day for 15 years," she said.

Her routine:
- Morning crossword with coffee (15 min)
- Sudoku after breakfast (15 min)
- Word search before lunch (15 min)

The doctor literally wrote down her routine to recommend to other patients.

She only uses large-print puzzles now. Says "life's too short to squint!"

I helped her put together some free ones to share - she loves helping people stay sharp.

Anyone else have experience with puzzles improving memory?"""

Results after 30 days:
- Sleep improved dramatically (fall asleep in 10 min vs 1 hour)
- Anxiety way down
- Actually feel productive
- Memory noticeably better
- No more doom scrolling depression

The trick was making it EASY. I put puzzle books everywhere - bathroom, kitchen, bedside, car.

Now when I reach for my phone, I grab a puzzle instead.

My favorite are the large-print ones - easier on the eyes during long sessions.

Has anyone else replaced social media with puzzles? How did it go?"""
