Scan for \"gimme\" clues (ones you know immediately)\n2. Fill in proper nouns and common words\n3. Let crossing letters guide harder clues\n4. Save themed clues for last (they often connect)\n\nThis approach builds momentum and confidence.\n\nTry it on your next puzzle and notice the difference!\n\nMargaret Thompson, Retired Educator\n\nP.S.
