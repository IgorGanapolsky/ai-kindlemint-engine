**Subject:** How Margaret solved 100 puzzles in 2 weeks

```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to share an amazing success story with you.

Margaret, 72, from Florida wrote to me last week:

"Igor, I was skeptical about digital puzzles at first. But the large print makes them so much easier than the tiny newspaper puzzles! 

I finished all 100 puzzles in just 2 weeks. My doctor says my cognitive test scores have improved, and I feel sharper than I have in years.

My grandchildren are amazed that Grandma is better at puzzles than they are now! 😊"

Margaret isn't unique. Here's what our puzzle community is saying:

⭐ "Best $8.99 I ever spent!" - Robert, 68
⭐ "Finally, puzzles I can actually see!" - Dorothy, 75  
⭐ "My daily brain workout!" - Frank, 71
