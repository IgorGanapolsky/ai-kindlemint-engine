# Deprecated Validators

These validators have been replaced by the unified validator:
- `/scripts/unified_sudoku_qa_validator.py` - Single source of truth

## Why these were deprecated:
- Multiple validators creating contradicting reports
- Each checking different aspects without coordination
- Confusing output with 5+ different report files
- No visual validation in most validators

## DO NOT USE THESE - Use unified_sudoku_qa_validator.py instead!
