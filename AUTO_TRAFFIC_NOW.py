Her routine:
- Morning: Crossword with breakfast (15 min)
- Lunch: Quick word search (10 min)  
- Evening: Sudoku before bed (20 min)

The neurologist was amazed at her cognitive test scores. Said the variety of puzzles creates new neural pathways.

She swears by large-print puzzle books - says "why strain your eyes when you're training your brain?"

Anyone else seen cognitive improvements from daily puzzles? Would love to hear your stories!"""

Started doing puzzles instead. Game changer.

Benefits after 30 days:
- Sleep improved dramatically
- Anxiety almost gone
- Actually feel accomplished 
- Mind feels sharper

The key was making it easy - I keep puzzle books everywhere. Kitchen, bathroom, bedside table.

If you're struggling with social media addiction, try puzzles. Your brain will thank you."""

Started doing ONE sudoku puzzle every morning before checking email.

Results:

It's like a warm-up for your brain. Gets the gears turning before you tackle real work.

Try it for a week. Just 15 minutes. Watch what happens to your productivity."""
