**Title:** Warning: Don't make this mistake with brain training puzzles

**Content:**
I've been researching cognitive health for my thesis, and I keep seeing people make the same mistake...

They do the SAME type of puzzle every day.

Research shows you need variety:
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday: Logic puzzles (Sudoku)
- Tuesday/Thursday: Word puzzles (Crosswords)
- Weekends: Visual puzzles (Word searches)

The brain adapts quickly. Variety = better results.

I put together a free collection of mixed puzzles based on the research. Happy to share if anyone's interested.

What types of puzzles do you rotate through?
