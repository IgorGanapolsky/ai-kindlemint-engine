**Title:** Free large-print Sudoku collection (made these for my mom with macular degeneration)

**Content:**
My mom loves Sudoku but most books have tiny print. Her eye doctor said straining to see was making her condition worse.

So I made her a collection with:
- Extra large print (she can actually see it!)
- High contrast black on white
- Plenty of space to write
- Progressive difficulty

She's so happy she can enjoy puzzles again without eye strain.

I have the PDF if anyone else needs large-print puzzles for themselves or loved ones. Completely free, just want to help.
