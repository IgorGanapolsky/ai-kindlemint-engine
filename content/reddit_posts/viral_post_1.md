**Title:** My 82-year-old grandmother just scored 150 on a cognitive test - her secret? Daily puzzles

**Content:**
Doctor was shocked. She's sharper than people half her age.

Her routine:
- Morning: One crossword with coffee  
- Afternoon: 2-3 Sudoku puzzles
- Evening: Word search before bed

She specifically uses large-print puzzles because "life's too short to squint."

The doctor said the variety is key - different puzzles exercise different parts of the brain.

What's your experience with puzzles and mental sharpness?
