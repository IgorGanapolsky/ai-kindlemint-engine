Hi r/sudoku!

I've been creating large print Sudoku puzzles specifically for seniors and people with vision issues. The numbers are 20pt+ font size - much easier on the eyes than typical puzzle books.

I'm giving away 5 free puzzles to get feedback. No email required, just instant download.

What's included:
- 5 progressive puzzles (easy to medium difficulty)
- Extra large print (20pt+ font)
- Complete solutions
- Designed for comfortable solving

If you like them, I have a full book of 100 puzzles for $4.99.

Would love to hear your thoughts! What size print do you prefer for puzzles?

Found something that might help! 

My mom loves doing puzzles but was struggling with the tiny print in most puzzle books. I found these free large print Sudoku puzzles that are SO much easier to see.

The numbers are huge - like 3x bigger than normal puzzles. She can actually do them without her magnifying glass now!

Hope this helps someone else's parent/grandparent too! ❤️
