Hi again!

Just a friendly reminder about the Large Print Sudoku Puzzles.

Did you know that regular brain training can:
- Improve memory by 20%
- Reduce cognitive decline
- Keep seniors mentally sharp

But most puzzles are too hard to read for seniors.

That's why I created these large print versions.

Only $2.99 for 100 puzzles!

Best regards,
Igor
