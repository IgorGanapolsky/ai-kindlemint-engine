**Resolution Type:** {reason}
**Closed by:** Manual cleanup script
**Timestamp:** {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC')}

### Cleanup Action:
This orchestration health issue has been closed as part of system maintenance.
The enhanced auto-closer system is now active to prevent issue accumulation.

### System Improvements:
- ‚úÖ Enhanced auto-closer with better health detection
- ‚úÖ Daily cleanup of old health reports  
- ‚úÖ Duplicate report prevention
- ‚úÖ More lenient health criteria

For current system status, monitor GitHub Actions or wait for the next health report.
