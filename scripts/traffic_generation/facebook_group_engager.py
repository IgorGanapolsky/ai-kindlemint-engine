My physical therapist (who's 78 and sharp as a tack) taught me the "Corner Notation System":

Instead of writing tiny numbers in cells, she uses the corners:
- Top-left corner = 1,2
- Top-right = 3,4
- Center = 5
- Bottom-left = 6,7
- Bottom-right = 8,9

This way you can fit all possibilities without cluttering the cell! She also swears by large print puzzles to reduce eye strain.

What's your favorite solving technique? Always love learning new methods! üòä""",
