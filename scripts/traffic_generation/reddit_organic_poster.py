**The "Pencil Mark Reduction" Method:**

1. Start by penciling in ALL possible numbers in each empty cell
2. Look for cells with only 2-3 possibilities - these are your "anchors"
3. When you place a number, immediately erase it from all cells in that row, column, and box
4. The puzzle practically solves itself!

Researchers followed 500 adults aged 65+ for 6 months:
- Group A: Did one Sudoku puzzle daily
- Group B: Control group (no puzzles)

Results:
- 23% improvement in short-term memory tests
- 19% faster problem-solving speed
- 31% reported feeling "mentally sharper"

The key was consistency - even easy puzzles showed benefits!

My mom (76) has been doing them for years and she's sharp as a tack. She jokes that Sudoku is her "brain's morning coffee."

Anyone else notice cognitive improvements from regular puzzling?"""

Benefits I've noticed:
- No more headaches after puzzle sessions
- Can actually see the numbers clearly (revolutionary, I know)
- More enjoyable experience overall
- Can puzzle for longer without eye strain

I was stubborn about it at first ("I don't need large print!") but honestly, why make things harder than they need to be?

For anyone interested, I found some free large print samples online that got me hooked. The bigger grids just make the whole experience more pleasant.

Has anyone else made the switch? Or am I just getting old? üòÖ"""
