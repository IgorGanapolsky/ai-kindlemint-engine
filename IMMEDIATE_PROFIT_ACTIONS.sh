**Title:** My 82-year-old grandmother just scored 150 on a cognitive test - her secret? Daily puzzles

**Content:**
Doctor was shocked. She's sharper than people half her age.

Her routine:
- Morning: One crossword with coffee  
- Afternoon: 2-3 Sudoku puzzles
- Evening: Word search before bed

She specifically uses large-print puzzles because "life's too short to squint."

The doctor said the variety is key - different puzzles exercise different parts of the brain.

What's your experience with puzzles and mental sharpness?

(If anyone wants the free puzzles she uses, I can share the link)

**Title:** Warning: Don't make this mistake with brain training puzzles

**Content:**
I've been researching cognitive health for my thesis, and I keep seeing people make the same mistake...

They do the SAME type of puzzle every day.

Research shows you need variety:
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday: Logic puzzles (Sudoku)
- Tuesday/Thursday: Word puzzles (Crosswords)
- Weekends: Visual puzzles (Word searches)

The brain adapts quickly. Variety = better results.

I put together a free collection of mixed puzzles based on the research. Happy to share if anyone's interested.

What types of puzzles do you rotate through?

**Title:** Free large-print Sudoku collection (made these for my mom with macular degeneration)

**Content:**
My mom loves Sudoku but most books have tiny print. Her eye doctor said straining to see was making her condition worse.

So I made her a collection with:
- Extra large print (she can actually see it!)
- High contrast black on white
- Plenty of space to write
- Progressive difficulty

She's so happy she can enjoy puzzles again without eye strain.

I have the PDF if anyone else needs large-print puzzles for themselves or loved ones. Completely free, just want to help.
