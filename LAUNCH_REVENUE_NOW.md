### **Problem: Reddit Credentials Not Working**

2. Make sure you created a "script" type app
3. Verify username/password are correct
4. Re-run: `./setup_reddit_credentials.sh`

### **Problem: Landing Page Down**
Your landing page: https://dvdyff0b2oove.cloudfront.net
- Should show the Sudoku signup form
- If down, check CloudFront status
- Backup: Use direct Gumroad link

### **Problem: No Traffic/Sales**
1. **Check Reddit posts are live**: Visit the subreddits and look for your posts
2. **Verify landing page tracking**: Open browser console and run:
   ```javascript
   JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sudoku_subscribers'))
   ```
3. **Test the funnel yourself**: Go through the signup and purchase flow
