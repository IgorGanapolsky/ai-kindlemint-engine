## 📝 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Test Locally First

1. ✅ Form created at https://formspree.io
2. ✅ Form ID `movwqlnq` integrated in code

### Step 4: Upload Lead Magnet

2. **Upload to ConvertKit**:
   - In your form settings, add as "Incentive"
3. **Use Dropbox/Google Drive**:
   - Upload and get public link
