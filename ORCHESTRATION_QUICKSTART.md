## 📊 Current Status

- **Discovered**: 11 books across your portfolio
- **Missing**: ASINs for your published books
- **Ready**: All orchestration infrastructure

## 🔧 Setup Steps (3 minutes)

### Step 1: Add Your Book ASINs

Since you published 6 books 3 weeks ago, you need to add their ASINs:

```bash
./add_book_asins.py
```

The script will guide you through adding ASINs for:
- Large Print Crossword Masters (Volumes 1-3)
- Large Print Sudoku Masters (Volumes 1-3)

**Where to find ASINs**: 
- KDP Bookshelf → Your Books → View on Amazon
- The ASIN is in the URL: amazon.com/dp/**B0XXXXXXXXX**

### Step 2: Launch the System

```bash
./launch_orchestration.sh
```

## 📈 What Happens Next

### Daily:

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **First Week**: Let it collect baseline data
2. **Check Daily Reports**: Look in `analytics_data/` each morning
3. **Monitor Trends**: BSR changes indicate sales velocity
4. **Act on Insights**: Use market gaps to plan new books

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Week 1: 
- Baseline performance established
- Initial competitive landscape mapped
- First ROI calculations

### Week 2-4:
- Trend identification
- Sales patterns emerge
- Market opportunities identified

### Month 2+:
- Predictive analytics
- Strategic recommendations
- Data-driven publishing decisions

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- **No actual sales numbers** (Amazon doesn't provide via public API)
- **BSR-based estimates** (directionally accurate, not precise)
- **Manual ASIN entry** (one-time setup)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "No books found"
→ Run the system first to auto-discover: `python -m kindlemint.orchestration_runner`

### "Rate limiting errors"
→ Built-in delays prevent this, but if it happens, the system auto-retries

### "Missing dependencies"
```bash
pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy
```

## 📞 As Your CTO

**My Recommendation**: Add your ASINs now and let the system run for 7 days. You'll have actionable data to optimize your next book launches and identify which series to expand.

**The goal**: Turn your publishing from guesswork into data-driven decisions.
