# Worktree Orchestration Test

This file tests the worktree orchestration system activation.

## Features Activated:
- ✅ Worktree assignment recommendations
- ✅ Token cost tracking integration  
- ✅ Git hooks for enforcement
- ✅ Metrics reporting

## Expected Behavior:
When committing this file, the pre-commit hook will:
1. Check if worktree orchestration is enabled (YES)
2. Recommend which worktree to use
3. Track token costs
4. Log metrics to reports/orchestration/

This is a test commit to verify the system is working correctly.
