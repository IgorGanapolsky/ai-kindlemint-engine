# Git Worktree Orchestration Improvement Plan

## Current State Analysis (July 7, 2025)

### Metrics
- **Worktrees Created**: 11
- **Orchestration Rate**: 8.3% (only 12 of 145 commits)
- **Cost Savings**: 4.9% ($3.60 saved)
- **Token Reduction**: 60% per orchestrated commit

### Issues Identified
1. **Low adoption** - 91.7% of commits bypass worktrees
2. **Stale worktrees** - Most on July 5 commits
3. **No monitoring** - Missing usage reports
4. **Poor integration** - New parallel processor not using worktrees

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Update All Worktrees (Today)
```bash
# Script to update all worktrees to latest main
for worktree in worktrees/*; do
    if [ -d "$worktree" ]; then
        echo "Updating $worktree..."
        cd "$worktree"
        git checkout main
        git pull origin main
        git checkout -
        cd -
    fi
done
```

### 2. Integrate Parallel Book Processor with Worktrees
Modify `parallel_book_processor.py` to use worktrees:
```python
async def process_job_in_worktree(self, job: BookJob) -> BookJob:
    """Process job in isolated worktree for better performance"""
    worktree = self._get_worktree_for_job(job)
    # Execute in worktree environment
```

### 3. Add Worktree Usage Monitoring
Create `worktree_monitor.py`:
- Track active worktrees
- Monitor task execution
- Generate usage reports
- Alert on stale worktrees

### 4. Enforce Worktree Usage
Update pre-commit hooks:
```bash
# Check if using appropriate worktree
if [[ "$PWD" == *"/worktrees/main-dev"* ]] && [[ "$TASK_TYPE" != "general" ]]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Use task-specific worktree for $TASK_TYPE"
    echo "Run: cd worktrees/$APPROPRIATE_WORKTREE"
    exit 1
fi
```

### 5. Create Worktree Dashboard
```python
# Real-time worktree status
python scripts/orchestration/worktree_dashboard.py

Output:
┌─────────────────┬────────┬─────────┬──────────┐
│ Worktree        │ Status │ Branch  │ Last Use │
├─────────────────┼────────┼─────────┼──────────┤
│ puzzle-gen      │ idle   │ main    │ 2 days   │
│ pdf-gen         │ active │ main    │ now      │
│ qa-validation   │ idle   │ main    │ 3 days   │
└─────────────────┴────────┴─────────┴──────────┘
```

## Expected Improvements

### With Full Implementation:
- **Orchestration Rate**: 8.3% → 80%+
- **Cost Savings**: $3.60 → $36+ per month
- **Book Generation**: 4 hours → 30 minutes
- **Parallel Tasks**: 1 → 6-8 simultaneous

### Performance Gains:
- CPU utilization: 25% → 80%
- Development speed: 10x faster
- Reduced context switching
- Better branch isolation

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1 (This Week):
- [ ] Update all worktrees to latest main
- [ ] Fix merge conflicts in metrics
- [ ] Create worktree monitoring script
- [ ] Integrate with parallel book processor

### Week 2:
- [ ] Add pre-commit enforcement
- [ ] Create usage dashboard
- [ ] Train workflow on worktree usage
- [ ] Document best practices

### Week 3:
- [ ] Full production deployment
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Cost analysis report
- [ ] Optimization tuning

## Success Metrics
- 80%+ commits use worktrees
- 10x reduction in book generation time
- 50%+ cost savings on API tokens
- Zero stale worktrees
- Real-time monitoring dashboard

## Conclusion
We have the infrastructure but aren't using it effectively. With these improvements, we can achieve the promised 10x productivity gains and 60%+ cost savings.
