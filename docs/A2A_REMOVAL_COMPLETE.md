# A2A Framework Removal Complete

## Removal Date
2025-07-01

## What Was Removed
- Google-inspired A2A (Agent-to-Agent) framework
- Message bus infrastructure
- Agent registry system
- All associated tests and documentation

## Why It Was Removed
- **Zero business value**: Books generated fine without it
- **Over-engineering**: Complex message passing for simple function calls
- **No real usage**: Remained experimental, never integrated into production
- **Unnecessary complexity**: Added layers of abstraction without benefit

## Current Architecture
The platform continues to work perfectly with:
- Direct function calls between components
- Simple orchestration scripts
- Clear, maintainable code structure

## Cost Savings
- Development time: No more maintaining unused framework
- Mental overhead: Simpler codebase to understand
- Testing burden: Fewer components to test

## Backup Location
All removed code has been backed up to: a2a_backup_20250701_122413
