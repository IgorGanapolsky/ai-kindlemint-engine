## üîß Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Get Buffer API Credentials

1. **Log into your Buffer account**
2. **Go to Buffer for Developers**: https://buffer.com/developers/api
3. **Create a new app** or use existing app
4. **Get your credentials**:
   - API Key
   - Access Token

### Step 2: Get Buffer Profile IDs

1. **In Buffer dashboard**, go to each social profile
2. **Copy the Profile ID** for each platform:
   - Twitter Profile ID
   - Facebook Profile ID  
   - Instagram Profile ID

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with real Buffer credentials:

```bash
# Buffer Social Media Automation
BUFFER_API_KEY=your_actual_buffer_api_key
BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_actual_buffer_access_token
BUFFER_TWITTER_PROFILE_ID=your_actual_twitter_profile_id
BUFFER_FACEBOOK_PROFILE_ID=your_actual_facebook_profile_id
BUFFER_INSTAGRAM_PROFILE_ID=your_actual_instagram_profile_id
```

### Step 4: Update AWS Secrets Manager (Production)

For production deployment, add Buffer credentials to AWS Secrets Manager:

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name "kindlemint/buffer-credentials" \
  --description "Buffer API credentials for social media automation" \
  --secret-string '{
    "BUFFER_API_KEY": "your_actual_api_key",
    "BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_actual_access_token",
    "BUFFER_TWITTER_PROFILE_ID": "your_twitter_id",
    "BUFFER_FACEBOOK_PROFILE_ID": "your_facebook_id",
    "BUFFER_INSTAGRAM_PROFILE_ID": "your_instagram_id"
  }'
```

## üß™ Testing the Integration

### Test Locally
```bash
python scripts/test_buffer_integration.py
```

### Test Workflow Integration
The Buffer integration will automatically activate when:
1. ‚úÖ A book is successfully published to KDP
2. ‚úÖ V3 Orchestrator receives success notification
3. ‚úÖ Promotion Pipeline Orchestrator triggers Buffer campaigns

## üìä What Happens When a Book is Published

### Automatic Marketing Sequence:
1. **Content Generation** - AI creates 10 unique social media posts
2. **Buffer Scheduling** - Posts scheduled across 7 days (morning/afternoon/evening)
3. **Multi-Platform** - Simultaneous posting to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram
4. **Rich Content** - Video content, SEO articles, Reddit opportunities
5. **Amazon Ads** - Sponsored Products campaigns (if configured)

### Post Types Generated:
- **Questions** - "What's your favorite puzzle type?"
- **Benefits** - "Large print puzzles reduce eye strain..."
- **Curiosity** - "Did you know crosswords improve memory?"
- **Social Proof** - "Join thousands who love our puzzles..."
- **Urgency** - "Limited time: New volume just released!"
