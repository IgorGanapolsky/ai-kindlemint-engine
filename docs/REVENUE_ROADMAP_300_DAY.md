**Missing Infrastructure**:

- ❌ No landing pages
- ❌ No analytics tracking

**But we DO have**:

### 💡 The Uncomfortable Truth

Our orchestration is built for PRODUCTION, not SALES.

We're like a factory that makes perfect widgets but has no sales team, no marketing department, and no customer list.

To hit $300/day, we need:
1. **Specific niche** (not "puzzle books")
2. **Email list** (captures 80% of value)
3. **Backend offers** (10x profit per customer)
4. **Traffic system** (consistent daily visitors)
5. **Conversion optimization** (A/B testing)

### 🎯 Next Action

If you want $300/day, STOP building more books and START building:
1. Landing page with email capture
2. 5-day email sequence
3. Bundle offer
4. Traffic campaign

The podcasts are clear: **"Focus beats volume every time"**

*Remember: The market doesn't care about your orchestration elegance. It cares about solving specific problems for specific people.*
