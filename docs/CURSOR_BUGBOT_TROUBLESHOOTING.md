# Cursor Bugbot Troubleshooting

## Issue: Bugbot Not Responding

Despite being enabled in Cursor dashboard and "bugbot run" being commented, Cursor Bugbot is not responding to PR #62.

## What We've Verified:
1. ✅ Bugbot enabled in Cursor dashboard (confirmed by user)
2. ✅ Repository has `.cursorignore` file
3. ✅ GitHub Action successfully commented "bugbot run"
4. ✅ Test file has obvious bugs (division by zero, eval(), etc.)
5. ❌ No Bugbot response after 10+ minutes

## Possible Issues:

### 1. Repository Not Properly Connected
- Cursor might need the EXACT repository name match
- Check if repository shows as "connected" in Cursor dashboard
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting GitHub integration

### 2. Permissions Issue
- Cursor app might not have correct permissions on this specific repo
- Check GitHub installed apps permissions for Cursor

### 3. Beta Service Issues
- Bugbot is in Beta and might have service disruptions
- No status page to check service health

### 4. Repository Size/Type
- Bugbot might have issues with larger repositories
- Could be rate limited or queued

### 5. Configuration Mismatch
- Dashboard might show "enabled" but not actually be active
- Try toggling Bugbot OFF then ON again

## Recommended Actions:

1. **Verify Repository Connection**
   - Go to https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=integrations
   - Check if `IgorGanapolsky/ai-kindlemint-engine` shows as connected
   - Look for any error messages or warnings

2. **Manual Trigger Test**
   - Try commenting just `bugbot run` (without automation)
   - Try `bugbot run verbose=true`
   - Wait and refresh page

3. **Check Cursor Settings**
   - Ensure "Only Run when Mentioned" is OFF
   - Check if there's a spending limit that might block it
   - Verify repository is not in any exclusion list

4. **Contact Support**
   - Since it's a paid feature, contact Cursor support
   - Report that Bugbot isn't responding despite being enabled
   - Reference PR #62 as example

## Alternative Solution: Use Existing Tools

Since you already have working AI code review tools:
- **Sentry AI** - Catching bugs and suggesting fixes
- **CodeRabbit** - Comprehensive code reviews  
- **DeepSource** - Static analysis

Consider if Cursor Bugbot adds unique value beyond these tools.

## QA Failures to Address

The failing CI checks need immediate attention:
1. Code Hygiene Check
2. QA Validation Pipeline  
3. Unit Tests
4. DeepSource blocking issues

These are unrelated to Bugbot but blocking the PR.
