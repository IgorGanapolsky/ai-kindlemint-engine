# Large Print Sudoku Masters - Market Alignment Implementation Plan

Based on comprehensive market analysis of bestselling Sudoku books, here are the critical improvements needed:

## ðŸš¨ Current Issues vs Market Requirements

### 1. **Print Size**

- **Fix**: Implement new `large_print_sudoku_generator.py`

### 2. **Layout**
- **Current**: Cramped puzzles trying to fit too much per page
- **Market Standard**: ONE puzzle per page, generous white space
- **Fix**: Use 6x6 inch puzzle size on 8.5x11 page

### 3. **Solutions Placement**
- **Current**: All solutions grouped at end of book
- **Market Standard**: Solutions after each section (every 10 puzzles)

- **Market Standard**:
  - Welcome page
  - How to play tutorial
  - Tips and strategies

```

### Phase 3: Update Metadata

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Comparison
