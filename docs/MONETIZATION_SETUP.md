    e.preventDefault();
    
    const formData = {
        email: document.getElementById('email').value,
        firstName: document.getElementById('firstName').value
    };
    
    const response = await fetch(API_URL, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(formData)
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    
    if (result.success) {
