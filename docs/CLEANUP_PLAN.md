# Documentation Cleanup Plan

## üö® Current State Analysis

### Problems Identified:
1. **85+ documentation files** scattered across docs/
2. **Massive MCP references** throughout (now obsolete)
3. **Duplicate content** across multiple files
4. **Outdated information** about AWS, MCP, old workflows
5. **No clear organization** - files mixed randomly
6. **Backup files** cluttering the directory

rm docs/requirements-*.txt
```

### Phase 2: Delete Outdated Content (Today)
```bash
# Delete all the outdated strategy files
rm docs/pay_per_crawl.md
rm docs/artifact_storage_strategy.md
rm docs/automated_market_research_prs.md
# ... (all the files listed above)
```

### Phase 3: Update Remaining Files (Today)
```bash
# Update WORKTREE_STATUS.md to remove MCP references
# Update any remaining files with current information
```

### Phase 4: Organize Structure (Today)
```bash
# Move files to appropriate subdirectories
# Ensure all essential files are in the right place
```

## üìä Expected Results

### Before Cleanup:
- **85+ files** in docs/
- **Massive MCP references** throughout
- **Duplicate content** everywhere
- **Outdated information** causing confusion
- **No clear organization**

### After Cleanup:
- **~15 essential files** in docs/
- **Zero MCP references**
- **No duplicate content**
- **Current, accurate information**
- **Clear organization** by category

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

1. **Zero MCP references** in any documentation
2. **No duplicate content** across files
3. **All information current** and accurate
4. **Clear organization** by category
5. **Essential files only** - no obsolete content
6. **Easy navigation** and finding information

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Reduced confusion** - developers know where to find info
2. **Faster onboarding** - clear, current documentation
3. **No outdated references** - everything matches current system
4. **Easier maintenance** - fewer files to keep updated
5. **Professional appearance** - clean, organized docs

This cleanup will transform the docs directory from a confusing mess into a clean, professional, and useful documentation system.
