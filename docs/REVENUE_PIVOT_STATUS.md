## 💡 Revenue Math Reminder

**Current State**: $0/day

**Path to $300/day**:
- 6,000 email subscribers
- 2% buy bundle monthly = 120 × $20 = $2,400
- 0.5% buy course = 30 × $60 = $1,800
- 5% join membership = 300 × $19 = $5,700
- **Total**: $9,900/month = $330/day ✅

## 🎯 30-Day Milestone

By end of Month 1:
- 500 email subscribers
- $50/day revenue
- Proven funnel
- Ready to scale with ads

## 🚨 Executive Decision

**As CTO, I'm declaring**: The orchestration is FROZEN until we hit $100/day revenue.

Every hour spent on code elegance is an hour not spent on customer acquisition.

The market doesn't care about our test coverage. It cares about solving problems for seniors who can't read small print.

**Next Action**: Deploy the landing page. Everything else can wait.
