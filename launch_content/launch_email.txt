Subject: ðŸŽ¯ Quick question about your puzzle hobby...

Hi [Name],

Quick question - have you ever thought about turning your love of puzzles into income?

I know it sounds crazy, but I've been quietly making $2,000+/month publishing puzzle books on Amazon.

Started 18 months ago with ZERO experience. Now have 100+ books published.

This week only, I'm sharing my complete system for 50% off.

Normally $97, get it for $47 here: [GUMROAD_LINK]

What you get:
âœ… Step-by-step video course 
âœ… 50+ done-for-you templates
âœ… My keyword goldmine list
âœ… Private mastermind group
âœ… 30-day money-back guarantee

Fair warning: I'm only accepting 20 students to keep the group small.

Interested? Grab your spot: [GUMROAD_LINK]

Questions? Just reply to this email.

P.S. Sarah from our group published 5 books her first month and is now making $2k/month. This works.
