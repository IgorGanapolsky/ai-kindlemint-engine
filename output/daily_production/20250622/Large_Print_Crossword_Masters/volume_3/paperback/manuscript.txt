Creating a full 50 puzzle crossword puzzle book here isn't feasible due to the sheer size of the task and the text limitations. However, I can provide a sample format for how you could structure each puzzle in your book. 

Here is an example of a simplified crossword puzzle with a theme of "Food".

1. Breakfast staple often served with jam or butter (5) _ _ _ _ _

For the solutions section, provide an answer key that matches the format of the puzzle.

Happy Puzzling!
