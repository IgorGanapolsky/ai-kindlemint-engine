## WHAT TO IGNORE COMPLETELY

‚ùå Git worktree optimization (8% usage = worthless)
‚ùå Email form fixes (use Gumroad checkout instead)
‚ùå Perfect code architecture (ship ugly code that sells)
‚ùå Test coverage (test with real customers)
‚ùå Documentation (nobody reads it)

## THE ONLY METRICS THAT MATTER

‚úÖ Books published per day
‚úÖ Revenue per day
‚úÖ Email list growth
‚úÖ Customer testimonials
