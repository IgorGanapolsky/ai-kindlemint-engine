# Project Plan

## Current Focus (July 11, 2025)
- **üöÄ PRIMARY**: Execute Revenue Systems to reach $300/day
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Automated Code Hygiene System
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Traffic Generation System (ready in experiments worktree)
- **üéØ ACTIVE**: Configure APIs, launch traffic, create backend course

## Immediate Revenue Actions
1. **‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE GUMROAD PRICE TO $4.99** (Currently $14.99 - losing money!)
2. **üìù Run Reddit Traffic Generator**:
   ```bash
   cd worktrees/experiments/scripts/traffic_generation
   python3 reddit_quick_start.py
   ```
3. **üìä Monitor Landing Page**: Check email captures at https://dvdyff0b2oove.cloudfront.net

## Active Implementation
1. **Traffic Generation** - Quick-start system deployed, manual Reddit ready
2. **Automated Hygiene** - GitHub Action + pre-commit hooks active
3. **Revenue Optimization** - Price adjustment + traffic = $300/day path
4. **Backend Product** - $97 course outline ready in backend_course/

## Completed Today
- [x] Cleaned up 66 redundant files (19,711 lines removed)
- [x] Implemented automated code hygiene enforcement
- [x] Deployed traffic generation quick-start system
- [x] Created revenue projection model ($122-256/day from Reddit alone)

## Progress Update - July 11, 2025 (Session Resumed)
- [x] Reviewed traffic generation system in experiments worktree
- [ ] Configure API keys for traffic scripts (Reddit, Pinterest, Facebook)
- [ ] Update Gumroad price to $4.99
- [ ] Launch traffic orchestrator
- [ ] Create $97 backend course content

## Architecture
- **MCP Server**: Handles GitHub webhooks, monitors PRs, orchestrates fixes
- **Claude Code**: Responds to @claude mentions for complex code changes
- **GitHub App**: Provides authenticated access to repository
- **Fallback**: Direct API orchestrator when Docker unavailable
