# ai-kindlemint-engine: KDP Publishing Automation Plan

## Notes
- Repository already cloned locally at /Users/igorganapolsky/workspace/git/ai/ai-kindlemint-engine
- README.md currently contains only a project title; no documentation yet
- README.md has been expanded with comprehensive documentation
- Initial project structure, requirements, and architecture have been designed
- Always update the README when making architectural decisions/changes
- Business goal: achieve $300/day net profit through a memory-driven, high-volume publishing engine.
- June 2025: Added CMOAgent sales copy JSON output (one-liner, about, personas) and synthetic market validation (AI persona validates book idea before generation)
- AWS Lambda/Step Functions deployment and GitHub Actions CI status currently unclear—needs review
- Next milestone: achieve $1 profit (revenue validation)
- Slack webhook leak remediated; README.md cleaned and no sensitive URLs remain
- New Slack webhook must be integrated securely (as GitHub secret and env var)
- .env.example created to document required environment variables
- Slack notification helper module (utils/slack_notify.py) added for Lambda runtime alerts
- deploy.yml exists; Slack notifications will be tested
- Deploy workflow job now succeeds, but the final Slack notification step fails. The `curl` command was updated to log the HTTP response code for debugging.
- Cover generation strategy: After attempting a Bannerbear integration and further refinements to the Pillow-based text overlay in `scripts/generate_covers.py` proved insufficient for desired quality, the focus is shifting to using advanced AI image generation models like Google's Gemini (via Vertex AI or other means) that can handle text rendering directly within the image. The `scripts/generate_covers.py` may be deprecated or repurposed for background art only if a hybrid approach is chosen later.
- New strategic direction (v2.0): Implement 'Memory-Driven Publishing Engine' using AWS DynamoDB (`KDP_Business_Memory` table) to store data on book generation, sales, and marketing. Agents (CTO, CMO, CFO) will be upgraded to be memory-aware and learning-based.
- The system needs to evolve from random topic selection to data-driven niche identification and domination.
- User Priority: Achieve $1 profit. Immediate focus is on fixing the CI/CD Slack notification and starting marketing efforts (generating new book covers, improving sales copy). Long-term memory implementation is de-prioritized for now.
- User Request: Enhance AI generation scripts (starting with `generate_covers.py`) to support fallback to other LLM providers like Gemini and Anthropic Claude, managing their respective API keys.
- Vertex AI Setup: Successfully configured GCP service account, roles, and JSON key for Vertex AI access. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is set up for local use, and `secrets/*.json` is added to `.gitignore`. `GEMINI_PROJECT_ID` is also configured. The `deploy.yml` workflow has been updated to handle GCP credentials via GitHub secrets.
- Vertex AI Imagen Access: The `scripts/generate_gemini_cover.py` script was created to call Vertex AI Imagen. However, testing revealed that the project requires access to a gated preview for the "Generative AI Images API" (`generativeai.googleapis.com`) to use Google-published image models. The necessary IAM role (`roles/aiplatform.publisherModelUser`) is unavailable without this preview. For now, cover generation will rely on the DALL-E/Replicate fallback.
- Vertex AI Script Fix: The `scripts/generate_gemini_cover.py` script was updated multiple times to handle different response schemas from the Vertex AI API (`bytesBase64`, `b64`, `bytesBase64Encoded`).
- Vertex AI Text Quality: After successfully calling the API, the generated image from the `imagegeneration@002` model had unreadable, garbled text, making it unsuitable for book covers. This approach is currently not viable.
- DALL-E 3 Viability: Manual generation with DALL-E 3 has proven to be the most effective strategy, yielding high-quality covers with legible text after minor prompt refinement. This is the path forward.
- User Context (Agent-Web-Scraper GAP Analysis): The user provided a GAP analysis for a separate project ('agent-web-scraper' / 'SaaS Growth Dispatch'), indicating it might be closer to revenue generation. While this provides important context for overall user priorities, current instructions are to proceed with the `ai-kindlemint-engine` plan.
- STRATEGIC PIVOT (June 16, 2025): User has directed a pivot to prioritize the 'Memory-Driven Publishing Engine (v2.0)'. The focus is now on building a learning system using DynamoDB to track book performance and drive profitable niche selection, rather than perfecting single book assets or CI/CD first. The `KDP_Business_Memory` DynamoDB table has been created.
- MEMORY MODULE CREATED (June 16, 2025): A new data access layer `kindlemint/memory.py` has been created to interact with the `KDP_Business_Memory` table.
