The Final Blueprint: The Scalable Publishing Enterprise plan.md (v2)
Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate Priority)
Goal: Establish the core observability, financial tracking, and data ingestion needed to build and scale a reliable, profit-driven business.

Implement Sentry & Seer AI Integration:
Action: The agent's first task is to integrate the Sentry SDK into all Python scripts and configure it in the GitHub Actions workflow. This will provide professional-grade error tracking, performance monitoring, and AI-powered diagnostics for the entire system.
Implement CostTracker Agent:
Action: The agent must build the CostTracker module to calculate the precise cost of each book by tracking API calls (OpenAI, DALL-E) and AWS compute costs.
Implement SalesDataIngestion Agent:
Action: The agent must build the module to automatically download KDP sales and royalty reports and store this performance data in our DynamoDB database.
Implement ProfitMarginCalculator:
Action: The agent must create a function that uses the output from the CostTracker and SalesDataIngestion agents to calculate the true net profit for every book and series.
Launch First Series:
Action: Once the foundational modules are in place, the agent will execute the launch_series.py script to publish Volume 1 of the "Large Print Crossword Masters" series to gather our first real-world performance data.
(Phases 2 and 3 remain the same as previously outlined)
