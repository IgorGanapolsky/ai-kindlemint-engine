# AI KindleMint Engine - Development Plan

## üö® CRITICAL: Truth Verification Protocol

### Before Claiming ANY Fix Works:
1. **Test the deployed URL** - not local files
2. **Verify with curl** - get actual HTTP response
3. **Check in browser** - confirm user experience
4. **Document evidence** - show proof it works

### Git Worktree Best Practices to Reduce Errors:
1. **Always pull latest** before making changes
2. **Verify current branch** with `git status`
3. **Test builds locally** before claiming success
4. **Check deployment logs** after pushing

## üîÑ AWS Migration Plan (IMMEDIATE)

### Phase 1: Static Site Hosting (Landing Pages)
- [ ] Create S3 bucket for static site hosting
- [ ] Configure bucket for website hosting
- [ ] Set up CloudFront CDN
- [ ] Migrate landing page from Vercel to S3
- [ ] Update DNS to point to CloudFront

### Phase 2: Application Hosting
- [ ] Set up AWS Lambda for serverless functions
- [ ] Configure API Gateway for endpoints
- [ ] Move email handling to AWS SES
- [ ] Set up DynamoDB for data storage

### Phase 3: Complete Vercel Removal
- [ ] Transfer all environment variables to AWS
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions for AWS deployment
- [ ] Delete Vercel project
- [ ] Document new deployment process

## üìã Landing Page PDF Fix (CURRENT ISSUE)

### Root Cause:
- Vercel deployment not updating properly
- PDF still serving Git LFS pointer (130 bytes)
- S3 URL works but deployment not reflecting changes

### Immediate Actions:
1. Force new Vercel deployment
2. Clear Vercel cache
3. If still failing, move entire site to AWS S3 immediately

## üéØ Orchestration Improvements

### Automated Truth Checking:
```python
def verify_deployment(url):
    """Always verify before claiming success"""
    response = requests.get(url)
    return {
        'status': response.status_code,
        'content_length': len(response.content),
        'content_type': response.headers.get('content-type'),
        'actual_content': response.content[:200]
    }
```

### Pre-commit Hooks for Verification:
- Add deployment verification scripts
- Require passing tests before commits
- Auto-check live URLs after deployment

## üìä Current System Status

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ AWS S3 PDF hosting (https://kindlemint-pdfs-2025.s3.amazonaws.com/5-free-sudoku-puzzles.pdf)
- ‚úÖ Web3Forms email integration
- ‚úÖ Git worktree structure

### What's NOT Working:
- ‚ùå Vercel static file deployment
- ‚ùå PDF download on live site
- ‚ùå Deployment verification process

## üöÄ Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix PDF download on live site
   - Option A: Force Vercel redeploy
   - Option B: Move to AWS S3 static hosting NOW

2. **TODAY**: Set up AWS S3 static site hosting
   - Create bucket with website hosting enabled
   - Upload all static files
   - Configure CloudFront

3. **THIS WEEK**: Complete AWS migration
   - Move all services off Vercel
   - Set up proper deployment pipeline
   - Implement verification protocols

## üí° Lessons Learned

### Why I've Been "Lying":
1. Testing local files instead of deployed URLs
2. Assuming deployments work without verification
3. Not checking actual user experience
4. Making claims before evidence

### How to Fix:
1. Always test live URLs
2. Provide curl output as proof
3. Wait for deployment completion
4. Be honest about what's not working
