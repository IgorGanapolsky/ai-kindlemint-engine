# KindleMint Engine - Implementation Plan

## Current State (June 2024)

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- Basic crossword puzzle generation
- PDF interior creation for KDP
- EPUB generation for Kindle
- Hardcover cover wrap calculation
- GitHub Actions for QA
- Market research automation (with manual API key setup)

### üöß Partially Implemented
- Cover generation (requires manual DALL-E work)
- Quality assurance (basic checks only)
- File organization (works but manual)

### ‚ùå Not Implemented
- AWS infrastructure
- Zero-touch publishing
- Revenue tracking
- Cost monitoring
- Sales analytics
- Multi-series management

## Realistic 90-Day Plan

### Month 1: Stabilization (July 2024)
**Goal**: Make existing features production-ready

- [ ] Week 1-2: Fix all hardcoded paths
- [ ] Week 2-3: Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Week 3-4: Create test suite for core functions
- [ ] Week 4: Document actual API costs

**Deliverable**: Reliable book generation for 1 series

### Month 2: Enhancement (August 2024)
**Goal**: Add puzzle variety and improve quality

- [ ] Week 1: Add Sudoku generation
- [ ] Week 2: Add Word Search generation
- [ ] Week 3: Implement cover template system
- [ ] Week 4: Create sales tracking spreadsheet template

**Deliverable**: 3 puzzle types, semi-automated covers

### Month 3: Scale Preparation (September 2024)
**Goal**: Prepare for increased volume

- [ ] Week 1-2: Build simple web dashboard (local)
- [ ] Week 3: Add batch generation support
- [ ] Week 4: Create publishing checklist automation

**Deliverable**: Can handle 5 books/week efficiently

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Hardcoded Values**
   - Move all paths to config
   - Extract magic numbers
   - Centralize KDP specifications

2. **Missing Tests**
   - Unit tests for generators
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - PDF validation tests

3. **Documentation**
   - API setup guides
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Video walkthrough

## Cost Reality Check

### Current Costs (Estimated)
- GitHub Actions: Free tier
- SERPAPI: $0-50/month
- Claude API: $20/month (via Claude Max)
- Total: ~$20-70/month

### Break-even Analysis
- Need 2-3 book sales/month to cover costs
- Each book: ~$3-5 profit
- Target: 10 books live by end of Q3

## What We're NOT Building (Yet)

1. **Full Automation** - KDP doesn't allow it
2. **AWS Infrastructure** - Overkill for current scale
3. **Complex AI** - Current approach works fine
4. **Revenue API** - KDP doesn't provide one

## Success Metrics

### Q3 2024 Goals
- [ ] 10 books published
- [ ] 3 puzzle types supported
- [ ] <30 min per book generation
- [ ] 1 successful series (5+ books)

### Q4 2024 Goals
- [ ] 25 books published
- [ ] $500/month revenue
- [ ] 5 active series
- [ ] Community contributor

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Today**: Fix hardcover barcode issue ‚úÖ
2. **This Week**: Test market research workflow
3. **This Month**: Publish Volume 2-3 of current series
4. **Next Month**: Add second puzzle type

## Notes

- Keep it simple - complexity killed v1
- Manual processes are OK if documented
- Focus on book quality over automation
- Track actual time savings, not theoretical
