# Project Plan

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Current Focus (July 11-12, 2025)
- **🚀 PRIMARY**: Execute Revenue Systems to reach $300-1000/day
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Complete Autonomous Revenue Platform
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Multi-Agent System with A2A-lite features
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Advanced AI Integrations (Grok 4, RAG, RL)
- **🎯 READY**: Launch with `python3 LAUNCH_REVENUE_ENGINE.py`

## Immediate Revenue Actions
1. **⚠️ UPDATE GUMROAD PRICE TO $4.99** (Currently $14.99 - losing money!)
2. **📝 Run Reddit Traffic Generator**:
   ```bash
   cd worktrees/experiments/scripts/traffic_generation
   python3 reddit_quick_start.py
   ```
3. **📊 Monitor Landing Page**: Check email captures at https://dvdyff0b2oove.cloudfront.net

## Active Implementation
1. **Autonomous Revenue System** ✅ - Complete AI-powered system with:
   - Memory-based decision making
   - Reinforcement learning for self-improvement
   - 24/7 autonomous operation capability
   - One-command launch: `python3 LAUNCH_REVENUE_ENGINE.py`
2. **Traffic Generation** - Quick-start system deployed, manual Reddit ready
3. **Automated Hygiene** - GitHub Action + pre-commit hooks active
4. **Revenue Path** - AI optimizes: content → traffic → conversions → $300/day

## Completed Today
- [x] Cleaned up 66 redundant files (19,711 lines removed)
- [x] Implemented automated code hygiene enforcement
- [x] Deployed traffic generation quick-start system
- [x] Created revenue projection model ($122-256/day from Reddit alone)

## Progress Update - July 11, 2025 (Session Resumed)
- [x] Reviewed traffic generation system in experiments worktree
- [x] Built autonomous revenue engine with memory system
- [x] Created reinforcement learning engine (self-improving AI)
- [x] Developed full autonomous orchestrator (24/7 operation)
- [x] Generated launch scripts and shortcuts
- [x] Implemented multi-agent worktree workflow
- [x] Created Grok 4 enhanced engine
- [x] Built RAG revenue knowledge base
- [x] Developed ULTIMATE autonomous engine ($1000/day target)
- [x] Spawned 12 research agents for parallel development
- [ ] Configure API keys for traffic scripts (or use manual mode)
- [ ] Update Gumroad price to $4.99 (CRITICAL!)
- [ ] Launch autonomous system

## Multi-Agent Research System Active
Successfully spawned agents for:
- agntcy.org automation platform research
- Startup Ideas Podcast revenue opportunities
- CVS Health UQLM pattern analysis
- LLM evaluation best practices (hamel.dev)
- Multiple Snipd episodes (5 different episodes)
- YouTube content strategy
- Pydantic AI framework integration

PRs created by agents: 4 successful, more in progress
=======
## Current Focus (July 11, 2025)
- **PRIMARY**: Setting up official GitHub MCP Server (github/github-mcp-server)
- **INTEGRATION**: Claude Code GitHub Actions for AI-powered PR assistance
- **AUTOMATION**: Continuous PR monitoring with automatic CI fix capabilities

## Active Implementation
1. **Docker Installation** - Required for MCP server
2. **GitHub MCP Server** - Official implementation with webhook support
3. **Claude Code Actions** - Already configured, needs API key in secrets
4. **GitHub App Integration** - App ID 1554609 with private key authentication

## Immediate Tasks
- [ ] Install Docker on the system
- [ ] Deploy GitHub MCP server with docker-compose
- [ ] Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to GitHub repository secrets
- [ ] Test automated PR fixing on existing PRs (#185, #186, #187)
- [ ] Enable auto-merge for approved PRs (after testing)
>>>>>>> origin

## Architecture
- **MCP Server**: Handles GitHub webhooks, monitors PRs, orchestrates fixes
- **Claude Code**: Responds to @claude mentions for complex code changes
- **GitHub App**: Provides authenticated access to repository
- **Fallback**: Direct API orchestrator when Docker unavailable
