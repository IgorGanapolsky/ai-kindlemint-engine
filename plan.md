# Project Plan

## Current Focus
- MCP server orchestration for automated CI/CD and PR cleanup
- GitHub App integration and secure deployment on AWS EC2
- Minimal permissions and event subscriptions for security

## Next Steps
- Confirm webhook delivery and agent actions in MCP server logs
- Develop/modify agents for custom automation (CI/CD cleanup, PR auto-fix, etc.)
- Harden deployment (HTTPS, domain, scaling, monitoring)
- Keep `docs/WORKTREE_STATUS.md` up to date for seamless handoff

## Reference
- See `docs/WORKTREE_STATUS.md` for the latest orchestration and deployment state.
