# Project Plan

## Current Focus
- GitHub workflow orchestration via direct API integration (GitHub PAT)
- Automated CI/CD and PR management without server infrastructure
- Testing and implementing custom automation workflows

## Recent Pivot
- Moved from MCP server approach to direct GitHub API due to infrastructure limitations
- Implemented `scripts/github_workflow_orchestrator.py` for full workflow automation
- GitHub App (ID: 1554609) configured for future webhook-based automation

## Next Steps
- Test and enhance GitHub workflow orchestration capabilities
- Implement custom automation agents using the orchestrator
- Handle existing PRs (#185, #186, #187) with new automation
- When Docker/AWS available: Resume MCP server deployment
- Keep `docs/WORKTREE_STATUS.md` up to date for seamless handoff

## Reference
- See `docs/WORKTREE_STATUS.md` for the latest orchestration and deployment state.
