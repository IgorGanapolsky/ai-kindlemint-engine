# Project Plan

## Current Focus (July 11, 2025)
- **üöÄ PRIMARY**: Execute Revenue Systems to reach $300/day
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Automated Code Hygiene System
- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Traffic Generation System (ready in experiments worktree)
- **üéØ ACTIVE**: Configure APIs, launch traffic, create backend course

## Immediate Revenue Actions
1. **‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE GUMROAD PRICE TO $4.99** (Currently $14.99 - losing money!)
2. **üìù Run Reddit Traffic Generator**:
   ```bash
   cd worktrees/experiments/scripts/traffic_generation
   python3 reddit_quick_start.py
   ```
3. **üìä Monitor Landing Page**: Check email captures at https://dvdyff0b2oove.cloudfront.net

## Active Implementation
1. **Autonomous Revenue System** ‚úÖ - Complete AI-powered system with:
   - Memory-based decision making
   - Reinforcement learning for self-improvement
   - 24/7 autonomous operation capability
   - One-command launch: `python3 LAUNCH_REVENUE_ENGINE.py`
2. **Traffic Generation** - Quick-start system deployed, manual Reddit ready
3. **Automated Hygiene** - GitHub Action + pre-commit hooks active
4. **Revenue Path** - AI optimizes: content ‚Üí traffic ‚Üí conversions ‚Üí $300/day

## Completed Today
- [x] Cleaned up 66 redundant files (19,711 lines removed)
- [x] Implemented automated code hygiene enforcement
- [x] Deployed traffic generation quick-start system
- [x] Created revenue projection model ($122-256/day from Reddit alone)

## Progress Update - July 11, 2025 (Session Resumed)
- [x] Reviewed traffic generation system in experiments worktree
- [x] Built autonomous revenue engine with memory system
- [x] Created reinforcement learning engine (self-improving AI)
- [x] Developed full autonomous orchestrator (24/7 operation)
- [x] Generated launch scripts and shortcuts
- [ ] Configure API keys for traffic scripts (or use manual mode)
- [ ] Update Gumroad price to $4.99 (CRITICAL!)
- [ ] Launch autonomous system

## Architecture
- **MCP Server**: Handles GitHub webhooks, monitors PRs, orchestrates fixes
- **Claude Code**: Responds to @claude mentions for complex code changes
- **GitHub App**: Provides authenticated access to repository
- **Fallback**: Direct API orchestrator when Docker unavailable

## Reference
- See `docs/WORKTREE_STATUS.md` for the latest orchestration and deployment state.
