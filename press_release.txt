New Study: Large Print Puzzles Reduce Anxiety in Memory Care Residents by 40%

[CITY, Date] - A new puzzle program designed specifically for seniors with vision challenges has shown remarkable results in reducing anxiety and increasing engagement in memory care facilities.

The program, which features extra-large print puzzles with high contrast printing, has been adopted by over 50 senior care facilities in the past month.

"We saw immediate results," says Mary Thompson, Activity Director at Sunshine Senior Living. "Residents who previously avoided activities due to vision issues are now actively participating. The large print makes all the difference."

Key findings from facilities using the program:
• 40% reduction in reported anxiety levels

• 5 hours/week saved in staff planning time

The puzzles are specifically designed with:
