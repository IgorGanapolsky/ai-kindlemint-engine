            The badge validation agent detected fake or placeholder badges in README.md.
            
            ### Common Issues:
            - Badges showing fake percentages (95%, 100%)  
            - Static badges with placeholder text ("Ready", "Enabled")
            - Badges linking to non-existent services
            
            ### Action Required:
            1. Remove all fake/static badges
            2. Only use badges that show real metrics from actual services
            3. Ensure all badge URLs are accessible and valid
