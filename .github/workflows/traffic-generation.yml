          The breakthrough was learning the XY-Wing technique. If you have three cells that form a pattern where they share candidates in a specific way, you can eliminate candidates from cells that see all three.

          It sounds complex but once you see it, you can''t unsee it! 

          Now I''m hooked on expert puzzles. Found some great large-print books that make the longer solving sessions much easier on the eyes.

          What technique gave you your breakthrough moment?'''

          - Regular puzzlers had better working memory scores

          I''ve been doing puzzles before bed instead of scrolling, and my sleep quality has definitely improved.
