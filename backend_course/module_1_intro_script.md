## Video 1.1: Welcome to Your Puzzle Publishing Journey (5 minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and welcome to Create Your Own Puzzle Book - the only course you'll ever need to build a profitable puzzle publishing business on Amazon KDP.

In the next 30 days, you're going to go from complete beginner to published author with your first puzzle book live on Amazon. But more importantly, you'll have a system to create dozens more."

### Your Transformation (1 minute)
"Just 18 months ago, I was exactly where you are now. I loved puzzles but had no idea they could be a business. Today, I have over 100 puzzle books published, generating consistent monthly income.

Here's what's possible:
- Sarah from our community: $2,000/month after 3 months
- Mike started at 67 years old: Now makes $3,500/month
- Jennifer, a stay-at-home mom: Published 25 books while raising kids

This isn't about getting rich quick. It's about building a real asset that pays you month after month."

### Course Overview (2 minutes)
"Here's exactly what we'll cover:

Week 1: You'll discover why puzzle books are the perfect publishing niche and identify your first profitable sub-niche. We'll get your KDP account set up and ready.

Week 2: I'll show you my rapid puzzle creation system. You'll create your first 100 puzzles and format them professionally.

Week 3: We'll design a cover that sells and optimize your book listing for maximum visibility.

Week 4: You'll learn my scaling secrets - how to turn one book into a publishing empire.

Plus, you get my personal templates, keyword lists, and access to our private community."
