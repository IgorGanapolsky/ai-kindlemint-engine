## Email 2: The Big Mistake (Day 1)

**Subject:** The #1 mistake that kills puzzle book profits

Hi [Name],

How are the puzzles treating you?

Yesterday I mentioned the #1 mistake people make with puzzle books...

Here it is: They create puzzles that are too difficult.

See, most puzzle creators make puzzles THEY would enjoy. But they forget their audience might want something different.

The sweet spot? Medium difficulty puzzles sell 3x better than hard ones.

Why? Because people buy puzzle books to relax, not to feel frustrated.

I learned this after my first book flopped. Only 12 sales in 3 months. ðŸ˜±

Then I adjusted the difficulty and republished. Same book, easier puzzles.

Result? 847 sales the next month. ðŸ’°

Tomorrow I'll show you the exact formula for creating puzzles people actually buy.

## Email 3: The Formula (Day 2)

**Subject:** My "Golden Formula" for $1000/month puzzle books

Hi [Name],

Ready for the formula that changed everything?

The 70-20-10 Rule:
- 70% medium difficulty puzzles
- 20% easy puzzles (for warming up)
- 10% hard puzzles (for variety)

This ratio keeps readers engaged without frustration.

But here's what really matters...

Using this formula, my student Sarah published her first book and made $1,247 in month one.

She had ZERO publishing experience.

Want to know exactly how she did it?

I've put together a free training that shows:
âœ“ How to create 100 puzzles in 60 minutes
âœ“ The cover design that doubled her sales
âœ“ Her exact keyword strategy

This training comes down in 48 hours, so watch it now while you can.

Week 2: Designed the cover and uploaded to Amazon
Week 3: First sale! ðŸŽ‰
Week 4: 73 sales

Now? She makes $4,100/month from 8 puzzle books.

She quit teaching and works from her kitchen table.

## Email 7: FAQ & Objections (Day 6)

**Subject:** "But I'm not creative..."

Hi [Name],

Getting lots of questions about the course, so let me address the big ones:

"I'm not creative. Can I still do this?"
YES! I provide templates for everything. It's more like assembling a puzzle than creating one.

"Is the market saturated?"
No way. Amazon sells 2.2 million puzzle books per MONTH. There's room for everyone.

"How long until I make money?"
Most students see first sales within 48 hours of publishing. Sarah made $127 her first week.

"What if I get stuck?"
You get direct access to me through our private group and monthly calls. I personally help every student succeed.

Remember, you get $100 off until tomorrow night:
