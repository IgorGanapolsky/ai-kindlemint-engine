Her secret? 45 minutes of puzzles every single day for the past 15 years.

Morning routine:
- Coffee + crossword (15 min)
- Sudoku after breakfast (15 min)  
- Word search before lunch (15 min)

She says the key is LARGE PRINT puzzles. "Why squint when you're trying to think?"

The doctor literally asked HER for puzzle recommendations. She was so proud ðŸ˜Š

I helped her put together some free puzzles to share if anyone wants to try her routine. Just trying to help others keep their minds sharp!

What's your experience with puzzles and memory? Would love to hear your stories.""",
